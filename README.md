# hearts-java-v2

My first Java project was [hearts-java](https://github.com/kr-matthews/hearts-java), implementing the card game [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)).
After making many mistakes and learning a lot, I redid that project here.

You can play (with a text-based interface) a game with 1-52 players, with the rest being the computer player I programmed, which plays a simple but reasonable strategy. Gameplay includes all standard rules (breaking hearts, shooting the moon, not losing by shooting the moon, etc.).
